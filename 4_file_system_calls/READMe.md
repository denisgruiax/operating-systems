## Warning. ⚠️
These are some small examples of what I can do with file system call functions. I could learn a lot more theory over the internet and I could do more examples, but I have to prioritize other topics.

There are also file functions that are an abstraction of system call functions and are more performant in some cases and easier to use. System call functions are useful when I need a finer touch on the data I'm working with.
