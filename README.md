# Exercises from the Programming Techniques laboratory.
## Warning. ⚠️
This programs were solved for understanding understanding the fundamentals of working with the operating system, files, directors, processes and threads. They have not been verified and reviewed by any one. If you can provide any improvements like logic errors, code mistakes and so on, feel free to contact me or open a pull request by forking this repository.

## About the project. 🪴
### Purpose. 🎯
The purpose of this programs is to test the ability to solve problems that consist in the basics of working with: 📚
```sh
- Introduction: Useful Commands and Compiling Programs in Linux
- User Interfaces
- Command Files
- Regular Expressions. Filters. The sed Command
- File Systems. System Calls for Working with Files and Directories
- Processes
- Interprocess Communication Using Pipes
- Interprocess Communication Using Signals
- Threads
- Process Synchronization
```

### Built With. ⚒️
The programs can be build with gcc compiler.

## Getting Started. 🚀
### System requirements ✅
- Operating System: MacOS, Windows, Linux(Ubuntu for example), Windows Subsystem for Linux. (WSL)
- Programming Language: C
- Code Editor: I used Visual Studio Code

I used WSL as operating system, VSCode as code editor and to compile the code i made use of gcc compiler.

### Installation. 🪜
1. Install c/c++
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```

2. Compile from command line
   ```sh
   gcc -Wall app.c -o app
   ```
   
3. VSCode C/C++ extesion pack
   ```sh
   (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack)
   ```
   
4. Configure VSCode to run and debug C/C++ programs inside VSCode under WSL.
   ```sh
